Summary of important user-visible changes for ocl-1.2.2:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Minor adaptions to support recent and upcoming Octave versions.


Summary of important user-visible changes for ocl-1.2.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Minor adaptions to support Octave versions up to 7.3 (the most 
    recently released Octave version).


Summary of important user-visible changes for ocl-1.2.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Added support for logically indexed assignment with a scalar value,
    i.e., expressions like "A(B < 0) = 0;" now work with OCL matrix
    variables A and B.  The right-hand side may only be a single scalar.
    All other cases of logical indexing, in particular any
    right-hand-side expression with logical indexing using OCL matrices
    remains forbidden, since this would fundamentally break the
    asynchronous workflow of OpenCL computation (see discussion on
    project's homepage).

 ** Added or extended several OCL matrix functions.  Degree-based
    trigonometric functions (sind, cosd, etc.) and the "fix" function
    now work with OCL matrices.  The "min" and "max" functions now
    also work with a scalar as first argument and an OCL matrix as
    second argument.

 ** Added dummy save / load functionality to OCL variables.  This is
    added solely to avoid crashing when saving / loading workspaces
    which also contain OCL variables.  However, OCL data is never
    saved, since data availability generally depends on (OpenCL)
    context (see discussion on project's homepage).


Summary of important user-visible changes for ocl-1.1.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Minor adaptions to support older Intel GPU OpenCL drivers.


Summary of important user-visible changes for ocl-1.1.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Added support for complex numbers of single and double precision
    as OCL matrix data, including operators and math functions.
    Few restrictions apply (see help text of oclArray function).
    Compatibility requires octave >= 4.2.0 for OCL from now on.

 ** Added an OpenCL memory manager.  It increases performance with
    octave functions and scripts which operate on OCL matrices
    (i.e., longer sequences of standard operations on OCL matrices).


Summary of important user-visible changes for ocl-1.0.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Enabled support for Octave 4.4 and 5.1 (the most recently released
    Octave version).  Major internal changes.  A minor but visible
    side effect is the renaming of the OCL matrices' class names from
    "ocl double" to "ocl_double" etc.

 ** OCL matrix operators now also work with scalars of type double
    (i.e., with the octave default type; formerly, only scalars of the
    OCL matrix element type were allowed, e.g., int8).  Restrictions
    exist for large-magnitude scalar values of type (u)int64.


Summary of important user-visible changes for ocl-0.9.2:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Added new functions for transferring matrix data between octave
    and the OpenCL device, and for larger compatibility with Matlab:
    oclArray (), ocl_to_octave (), gpuArray (), gather ()

 ** Rearranged multiple function help texts, making 'oclArray' the
    new online help focus and switching node

 ** Updated README file; added "Getting Started" and "Troubleshooting"
    sections

 ** Changed the default name for the OpenCL library for GNU/Linux
    and BSD systems (to "libOpenCL.so.1")

 ** For the automatic selection of an OpenCL device, corrected for
    prioritizing fp64-capable OpenCL devices (important bugfix)


Summary of important user-visible changes for ocl-0.9.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Universalized loading of OpenCL library, making OCL generally
    independent of operating system; improved error reporting
